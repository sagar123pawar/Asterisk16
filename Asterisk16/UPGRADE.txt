===========================================================

From 16.0.0 to 16.1.0:

Core:
 - ast_bt_get_symbols() now returns a vector of strings instead of an
   array of strings.  This must be freed with ast_bt_free_symbols.

New in 16.0.0:

app_fax:
 - The app_fax module is now deprecated, users should migrate to the
   replacement module res_fax.

app_macro:
 - The app_macro module is now deprecated and by default it is no longer
   built.  Users should migrate to app_stack (Gosub).  A warning is logged
   the first time any Macro is used.

AMI:
 - The ContactStatus and Status fields for the manager events ContactStatus
   and ContactStatusDetail are now set to "NonQualified" when a contact exists
   but has not been qualified.
 - The ContactStatus event will no longer be sent by PJSIP when a device
   refreshes its registration.
 - The "Newexten" event is now part of the "dialplan" class. The documentation
   for Asterisk 15 already specified this, but the implementation was actually
   using the "call" class instead.

ARI:
 - The ContactInfo event's contact_status field is now set to "NonQualified"
   when a contact exists but has not been qualified.

Build System:
 - MALLOC_DEBUG no longer has an effect on Asterisk's ABI.  Asterisk built
   with MALLOC_DEBUG can now successfully load binary modules built without
   MALLOC_DEBUG and vice versa.  Third-party pre-compiled modules no longer
   need to have a special build with it enabled.

 - Asterisk now depends on libjansson >= 2.11.  If this version is not
   available on your distro you can use `./configure --with-jansson-bundled`.

chan_dahdi:
 - Timeouts for reading digits from analog phones are now configurable in
   chan_dahdi.conf: firstdigit_timeout, interdigit_timeout, matchdigit_timeout.

cdr_syslog:
 - The cdr_syslog module is now deprecated and by default it is no longer
   built.

res_config_sqlite:
 - The res_config_sqlite module is now deprecated, users should migrate to the
   replacement module res_config_sqlite3.

res_monitor:
 - The res_monitor module is now deprecated, users should migrate to the
   replacement module app_mixmonitor.

Core:
 - libedit is no longer available as an embedded library and must be provided
   by the system.
 - The module loader now enforces inter-module dependencies.  This ensures that
   a module is not started before another it depends on, even if preload is used.
   If a dependency is not available or fails to startup this will block any
   dependants from startup.
 - Parts of the Asterisk core which can load configuration from realtime are now
   built-in modules.  It is no longer necessary to preload realtime drivers as
   they are always initialized before the built-in modules.
