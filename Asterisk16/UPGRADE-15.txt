From 15.2.0 to 15.3.0:

res_pjsip
------------------
 * Users who are matching endpoints by SIP header need to reevaluate their
   global "endpoint_identifier_order" option in light of the "ip" endpoint
   identifier method split into the "ip" and "header" endpoint identifier
   methods.

res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip
------------------
 * The endpoint identifier "ip" method previously recognized endpoints either
   by IP address or a matching SIP header.  The "ip" endpoint identifier method
   is now split into the "ip" and "header" endpoint identifier methods.  The
   "ip" endpoint identifier method only matches by IP address and the "header"
   endpoint identifier method only matches by SIP header.  The split allows the
   user to control the relative priority of the IP address and the SIP header
   identification methods in the global "endpoint_identifier_order" option.
   e.g., If you have two type=identify sections where one matches by IP address
   for endpoint alice and the other matches by SIP header for endpoint bob then
   you can now predict which endpoint is matched when a request comes in that
   matches both.

New in 15.0.0:

Build System:
 - '--with-pjproject-bundled' is now the default when running ./configure
   It can be disabled with '--without-pjproject-bundled'.

Core:
 - Multi-stream support has been added so a channel can have multiple
   streams of the same type such as audio and video.

 - The 'Data Retrieval API' has been removed. This API was not actively
   maintained, was not added to new modules (such as res_pjsip), and there
   exist better alternatives to acquire the same information, such as the
   ARI. As a result, the 'DataGet' AMI action as well as the 'data get'
   CLI command have been removed.
